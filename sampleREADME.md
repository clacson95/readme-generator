## Installation
First, ensure `node.js` is installed. Second, ensure there is a `.gitignore` file (with `node_modules` and `.DS_Store` written inside) before installing any npm dependencies. Third, ensure your repository includes a `package.json` file. Create one by entering the `npm i -y` command in the terminal. Fourth, ensure the inquirer module is installed, using `npm i inquirer@^8.2.4` command in the terminal.

## Usage
Use the command `node index.js` to run the file and begin answering the prompts.
